1. Max Chunks To Make Array Sorted 2    -  using Partition Array Into Disjoint Intervals

2. Min Jumps With +i -i Moves   - extra distance logic

3. Best Meeting Point	- median of x coordinates, y coordinates

4. Segmented Sieve  - two corner cases - a) when multiple = 1
								 b) when a=1
5. Shortest Unsorted Continuous Subarray

6. Wiggle Sort   - pairwise swap

7. Wiggle Sort 2 - a b c d e f --> a f b e c d

8. Number Of Subarrays With Bounded Maximum - normal, okay, bounded elements

9. Smallest Range Covering Elements From K Lists -  push the first elements of all the k lists into a pq and process them one by one.

10. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row -  consider those elements with frequency = n
